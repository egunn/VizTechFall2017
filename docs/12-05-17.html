    <h3>Overview </h3>
    <p>
        This class will be the final consultation sessions for your projects.
    </p>

    <h3>Topics </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Review homework</li>
        <li>Individual consultations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Final Project Evaluation</h3>

    <h5>Original assignment:</h5>
    <p>
        The final project is an opportunity for you to create a visualization related to a topic that you find interesting. Ideally, it
        will serve as a portfolio piece that you can present to future employers. The project is very broadly defined: you will choose
        a topic, locate data related to that topic, and clean and present the data in a website using d3. Final projects must include
        at least two different views of a dataset, and may incorporate any of the graphical forms that we encounter in class (bar,
        line or area charts, scatterplots, maps, network diagrams, etc). Animation, annotation and interactivity that support graph
        function are encouraged. You will work throughout the semester to identify data, rough out concepts, and create a final
        visualization that presents your data in a clear and interesting form.
    </p>

    <h5>Has a clear focus</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>attempts to answer a question or set of closely related questions about a topic of interest</li>
        </ul>

    <h5>Is effective</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>data relates to the topic of the project</li>
            <li>information presented helps to answer the central question(s) </li>
        </ul>
    <h5>Is clear</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>uses labels, titles, explanatory text, animation, etc. to help me understand what's going on</li>
            <li>provides explanation about where the data comes from </li>
        </ul>
    <h5>Visualization makes sense for the data shown</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>it is possible to make comparisons that inform the central question</li>
            <li>the graphs clearly present the data, without obscuring important information or implying relationships that do not exist</li>
            <li>graph precision matches the expected user task </li>
        </ul>
    <h5>Is well designed</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>overall page is clear and well laid out (this does not mean complicated!)</li>
            <li>page layout does not interfere with function</li>
            <li>there are no significant legibility problems (text, colors, etc)</li>
            <li>label size, colors, and other features appear to be carefully thought out and support the graph function</li>
            <li>uses consistent style/approach from one chart to the next</li>
            <li>overall project is aesthetically appealing</li>
        </ul>
    <h5>Code functions as intended</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>page loads from Github, in the PS01 folder</li>
            <li>unresolved bugs do not interrupt page function: charts are displayed, buttons, dropdowns, etc. work as intended </li>
            <li>citations given for any large blocks of code imported from other people's work</li>
        </ul>




    <h3>Assignment</h3>
